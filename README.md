## 🌍 EarthSignals – Climate Change Insights Dashboard

EarthSignals is an interactive climate change insights dashboard that transforms raw global climate datasets into meaningful visualizations. 
The platform helps users understand trends in CO₂ emissions, temperature changes, and renewable energy adoption across countries, making climate data accessible for research, education, and policy awareness.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Climate change data is widely available but often scattered, complex, and difficult to interpret for non-experts. 
Policymakers, students, and researchers struggle to extract actionable insights from large datasets without technical tools or visual context.

## 💡 Solution Overview

EarthSignals bridges this gap by providing an intuitive, visual dashboard that allows users to:
- Select countries dynamically
- Explore climate trends through interactive charts and summary box for each country
- Identify top CO₂ emitters
- Understand correlations between temperature, emissions, and renewable energy

The platform converts raw datasets into clear insights, enabling data-driven discussions on climate action.
